This lab asked us to create code for a friend who is renovating their floors. 
We had to calculate the dimensions and give the cost depending on what type of flooring
they chose. A hard portion of the code was making the separate rooms and calculating for each. As always,
error checking was difficult. In lab, I was having a lot of difficulty creating the functions for the code,
but after help in the lab, creating functions made more sense. I believe I learned what I was supposed to this lab because
we were able to calculate the price of all the rooms using different types. 
Working with my partner this week was easy. During lab, we both took a task and worked on it by ourselves.
It was simple and this lab went well.
